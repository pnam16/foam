# Async Programming Comparison

## Promise vs Async/Await

### Overview

Both are ways to handle asynchronous operations, with `async/await` providing a more readable structure that solves callback hell.

### Performance

Performance is equivalent between the two approaches.

### Error Handling

- **Promise**: Uses `.catch()` method
- **Async/Await**: Uses `try/catch` blocks

## Task Queue Priority

### Microtasks vs Macrotasks

- **Microtasks** (e.g., `Promise.resolve().then(fn)`) have higher priority
- **Macrotasks** (e.g., `setTimeout(fn, 0)`) have lower priority

### Execution Order

1. **Microtasks** execute first, before browser rendering
2. **Macrotasks** execute after all microtasks and after browser rendering

### Example

```javascript
console.log("A");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("B"); // Macrotask
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("C"); // Microtask
});

console.log("D");
```

**Output:**

```
A
D
C   ← Microtask (runs first)
B   ← Macrotask (runs after)
```

## REST API vs RESTful API

### REST API

- An API designed based on REST (Representational State Transfer) principles
- Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs

### RESTful API

- An API that fully or nearly fully complies with REST principles
- Emphasizes that the API is designed correctly according to REST constraints, ensuring simplicity, scalability, and efficiency

## Type vs Interface

### Type

- Declares data types
- Represents various data types including primitives, union types, intersection types, objects, etc.

### Interface

- Declares data structure (usually objects)
- Primarily used to define the shape of objects
