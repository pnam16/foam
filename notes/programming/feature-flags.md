# Feature Flags

## Definition

Feature Flag Toggle is a mechanism that allows developers to:

## Key Capabilities

### Feature Control

- **Enable/Disable Features**: Activate or deactivate specific features in the application
- **Controlled Deployment**: Test new features with a small group of users (canary release) before widespread deployment

### Risk Management

- **Easy Rollback**: Quickly disable features if bugs are discovered without needing to rollback source code
- **Gradual Rollout**: Release features incrementally to monitor performance and user feedback

### A/B Testing

- **Performance Comparison**: Compare the effectiveness of different versions of features
- **User Experience Optimization**: Test variations to improve user engagement and satisfaction

## Implementation Benefits

### Development Workflow

- **Continuous Integration**: Deploy code continuously while keeping features hidden
- **Branch Management**: Reduce the need for long-lived feature branches
- **Testing**: Test features in production environment with select users

### User Experience

- **Personalization**: Show different features to different user segments
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Gradually introduce new functionality
- **User Control**: Allow users to opt-in/opt-out of experimental features

## Use Cases

### Common Scenarios

- **New Feature Rollouts**: Gradually release major features
- **Emergency Controls**: Quickly disable problematic features
- **User Segmentation**: Show features to specific user groups
- **Performance Monitoring**: A/B test performance optimizations
