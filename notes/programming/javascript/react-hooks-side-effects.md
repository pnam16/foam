# React Hooks & Side Effects

## Side Effects in React

### Definition

Side effects are any actions performed outside the component's render scope, similar to the concept of StatefulComponent.

### useEffect Hook

`useEffect` is the primary tool for handling side effects such as:

- Fetching data
- Updating the DOM
- Setting up subscriptions

### useEffect Parameters

1. **Callback Function**:
   - Contains the side effect logic
   - Can return a cleanup function (e.g., `clearInterval`, `removeEventListener`)
2. **Dependencies Array**:
   - `[]`: Runs only once after the first render
   - `[a, b]`: Runs whenever `a` or `b` changes
   - No array: Runs after every render

## useLayoutEffect

### Key Characteristics

- Runs **synchronously** after a component renders and before the browser paints the updated DOM
- Useful for reading or modifying the DOM immediately after rendering
- Ensures changes happen before the user sees the updated UI

## useCallback & useMemo

### Purpose

These hooks help optimize performance by memoizing functions and values to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Real-time Ranking System

### Requirements

- Player data (name, points, ranking) stored and continuously updated
- UI displays ranking table with automatic updates
- Support for real-time updates with low latency

### Implementation Options

- Leverage Redis for fast read/write operations
- Use WebSocket or [[Long polling]] for real-time communication
