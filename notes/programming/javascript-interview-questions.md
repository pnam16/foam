# JavaScript Interview Questions

## Scope & Hoisting

### Function Scope vs Block Scope

- **Function Scope**: Variables declared with `var` are accessible throughout the entire function
- **Block Scope**: Variables declared with `let` and `const` are only accessible within the block they're declared in

### Variable Hoisting

- `var` variables are hoisted (declaration moved to top of function scope)
- When calling `var` before declaration, it won't error but will be `undefined`
- Only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization

## Closures

### Definition

A closure occurs when an inner function can access variables from its outer function even after the outer function has finished executing.

### Real-world Frontend Example

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return {
    increment: () => ++count,
    getCount: () => count,
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment(); // 1
counter.getCount(); // 1
```

## Event Loop & Task Queues

### setTimeout vs Promise.resolve().then()

- `setTimeout(fn, 0)` is a **macrotask**
- `Promise.resolve().then(fn)` is a **microtask**
- Microtasks have higher priority and run before macrotasks

### Task Queue Priority

1. **Microtask Queue**: Runs immediately after call stack is empty
   - Examples: `.then()`, `async/await`, `queueMicrotask()`
2. **Macrotask Queue**: Runs after all microtasks are complete
   - Examples: `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `setImmediate`

## Const Immutability

### Important Note

`const` does NOT guarantee complete immutability when assigned to mutable objects/arrays:

```javascript
const obj = {name: "Ame"};
obj.name = "Zeno"; // ✅ Valid
obj.age = 25; // ✅ Valid
obj = {name: "Zenobyte"}; // ❌ Error: cannot reassign const variable
```
